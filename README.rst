Usage by example
----------------

Set up the basics:

.. code-block:: python

    from exactonline.api import ExactApi
    from exactonline.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
    from exactonline.storage import IniStorage

    # Create a function to get the api with your own storage backend.
    def get_api():
        storage = IniStorage('/path/to/config.ini')
        return ExactApi(storage=storage)
    api = get_api()

Get an invoice:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get an invoice by your own invoice number (YourRef).
    # Returns a dictionary, or raises ObjectDoesNotExist.
    invoice = api.invoices.get(invoice_number='F0005555')

It looks somewhat like this:

.. code-block:: python

    invoice == {
        u'AmountDC': 50.8,
        u'AmountFC': 50.8,
    # ...
        u'SalesEntryLines': [
            {u'AmountDC': 41.98,
             u'AmountFC': 41.98,
    # ...
             u'Description': u'Omzet backups',
             u'VATBaseAmountDC': 41.98,
             u'VATBaseAmountFC': 41.98},
        ],
    # ...
        u'VATAmountDC': 8.82,
        u'VATAmountFC': 8.82,
        u'YourRef': u'F0005555',
        u'__metadata': {u'type': u'Exact.Web.Api.Models.SalesEntry',
                        u'uri': u"https://start.exactonline.nl/api/v1/..."},
    }

Get relations:

.. code-block:: python

    relations_limit_2 = api.relations.filter(top=2)
    # that was cheaper than: api.relations.all()[0:2]

    relations_limit_2 == [
        {u'Code': u'              1068',
         u'ID': u'11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555',
         u'Name': u'ACME Corporation',
         u'__metadata': {u'type': u'Exact.Web.Api.Models.Account',
                         u'uri': u"https://start.exactonline.nl/api/v1/...')"}},
        {u'Code': u'               555',
         u'ID': u'22222222-3333-4444-5555-666666666666',
         u'Name': u'Daffy Duck Ltd.',
         u'__metadata': {u'type': u'Exact.Web.Api.Models.Account',
                         u'uri': u"https://start.exactonline.nl/api/v1/...')"}}
    ]

Update a relation:

.. code-block:: python

    daffy_duck = api.relations.get(relation_code='555')
    api.relations.update(daffy_duck['ID'], {'Name': 'Daffy Duck and sons'})

Delete a relation:

.. code-block:: python

    daffy_duck = api.relations.get(relation_code='555')
    api.relations.delete(daffy_duck['ID'])

Create an invoice:

.. code-block:: python

    customer_data = api.relations.get(relation_code='123')  # local relation_code
    customer_guid = customer_data['ID']
    invoice_data = {
        'AmountDC': str(amount_with_vat),  # DC = default currency
        'AmountFC': str(amount_with_vat),  # FC = foreign currency
        'EntryDate': invoice_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),  # pretend we're in UTC
        'Customer': customer_guid,
        'Description': u'Invoice description',
        'Journal': remote_journal,  # 70 "Verkoopboek"
        'ReportingPeriod': invoice_date.month,
        'ReportingYear': invoice_date.year,
        'SalesEntryLines': [],
        'VATAmountDC': str(vat_amount),
        'VATAmountFC': str(vat_amount),
        'YourRef': local_invoice_number,
        # must start uniquely at the start of a year, defaults to:
        # YYJJ0001 where YY=invoice_date.year, and JJ=remote_journal
        'InvoiceNumber': '%d%d%04d' % (invoice_date.year, remote_journal,
                                       int(local_invoice_number)),
    }
    # The SalesEntryLines need to be filled with a bunch of dictionaries
    # with these keys: AmountDC, AmountFC, Description, GLAccount,
    # VATCode where GLAccount holds the Journal remote GUID, and the
    # amounts are without VAT.

    api.invoices.create(invoice_dict)

You may need to play around a bit to find out which fields are
mandatory, and what kind of values the fields need.  The `Exact Online
REST resources list`_ isn't always clear on that.



Using element adapters
----------------------

Using the above works, but it's not really object oriented. If
available, you may be better off using one of the adaptable classes in
``exactonline.elements`` and subclassing that.

For example, this is how you could create your own interface to an Exact
Online customer.

.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have a MyRelation that looks like this:
    class MyRelation(object):
        relcode = 12345
        first_name = 'John'
        last_name = 'Doe'
        billing_address = None
        # ...

    # You could create an adapter subclass of ExactCustomer like this:
    class MyExactCustomer(ExactCustomer):
        def __init__(self, my_relation=None, **kwargs):
            super(MyExactCustomer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
            self._my_relation = my_relation

        def get_code(self):
            return str(self._my_relation.relcode)

        def get_name(self):
            return ' '.join([
                self._my_relation.first_name,
                self._my_relation.last_name])

        def get_address(self):
            address = self._my_relation.billing_address
            if address:
                return {
                    'AddressLine1': address.street_and_number(),
                    'Postcode': address.zipcode,
                    'City': address.city.name,
                }
            return {}

If you have the above set up, and have unique customer codes, then
writing/updating an Exact Online relation is as convenient as this:

.. code-block:: python

    johndoe = MyRelation(...)
    exactonline_relation = MyExactCustomer(my_relation=johndoe, api=api)
    ret = exactonline_relation.commit()

These adaptable elements are currently implemented for writing customers
(ExactCustomer) and invoices (ExactInvoice). See the files in
``exactonline/elements/`` for more info.



Setting up the link
-------------------

You'll need a storage backend. The default ``IniStorage`` can be taken from
``exactonline.storage``.

.. code-block:: python

    from exactonline.storage import IniStorage

    class MyIniStorage(IniStorage):
        def get_response_url(self):
            "Configure your custom response URL."
            return self.get_base_url() + '/oauth/success/'

    storage = MyIniStorage('/path/to/config.ini')

(Note that you're not tied to using ``.ini`` files. See
``exactonline/storage.py`` if you want to use a different storage
backend.)

You need to set up access to your Exact Online SaaS instance, by creating an
export link. See `creating Exact Online credentials`_ for more info.

Take that info, and configure it in your ``config.ini``.

.. code-block:: ini

    [server]
    auth_url = https://start.exactonline.co.uk/api/oauth2/auth
    rest_url = https://start.exactonline.co.uk/api
    token_url = https://start.exactonline.co.uk/api/oauth2/token

    [application]
    base_url = https://example.com
    client_id = {12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-0123456789ab}
    client_secret = ZZZ999xxx000

Create an initial URL:

.. code-block:: python

    api = ExactApi(storage=storage)
    url = api.create_auth_request_url()

The URL will look like this; redirect the user there so he may
authenticate and allow your application access to Exact Online (this is
OAuth)::

    https://start.exactonline.nl/api/oauth2/auth?
      client_id=%7B12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-0123456789ab%7D&
      redirect_uri=https%3A//example.com/oauth/success/&
      response_type=code

After authentication he will get redirected back to::

    https://example.com/oauth/success/?code=...

You should implement a view on that URL, that does basically this:

.. code-block:: python

    api.request_token(code)

At this point, you should configure your default division, if you
haven't already:

.. code-block:: python

    division_choices, current_division = api.get_divisions()
    api.set_division(division_choices[0][0])  # select ID of first division

Now you're all set!



Implemented resources
---------------------

View ``exactonline/api/__init__.py`` to see which resource helpers are
implemented.

Currently, it looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    invoices = Invoices.as_property()
    ledgeraccounts = LedgerAccounts.as_property()
    receivables = Receivables.as_property()
    relations = Relations.as_property()

But you can call resources which don't have a helper directly. The
following two three are equivalent:

.. code-block:: python

    api.relations.all()
    api.restv1(GET('crm/Accounts'))
    api.rest(GET('v1/%d/crm/Accounts' % selected_division))

As are the following three:

.. code-block:: python

    api.relations.filter(top=2)
    api.restv1(GET('crm/Accounts?$top=2'))
    api.rest(GET('v1/%d/crm/Accounts?$top=2' % selected_division))

And these:

.. code-block:: python

    api.invoices.filter(filter="EntryDate gt datetime'2015-01-01'")
    api.restv1(GET('salesentry/SalesEntries?' +
      '$filter=EntryDate%20gt%20datetime%272015-01-01%27'))
    api.rest(GET('v1/%d/salesentry/SalesEntries?' +
      '$filter=EntryDate%%20gt%%20datetime%%272015-01-01%%27' %
      selected_division)
    # convinced yet that the helpers are useful?

See the `Exact Online REST resources list`_ for all available resources.



Other benefits
--------------

The ExactApi class ensures that:

* Tokens are refreshed as needed (see: ``exactonline/api/autorefresh.py``).
* Paginated lists are automatically downloaded in full (see:
  ``exactonline/api/unwrap.py``).



Creating Exact Online credentials
---------------------------------

Previously, one could create an API from the Exact Online interface directly.
This was removed at some point between 2014 and 2015.

According to the `"how can I create an application key?" FAQ entry`_
you must now create one through the App Center.

    *Why am I unable to see the Register an API link and how can I
    create an application key?*

    All registrations are now configured through the App Center.
    Previously you were able to generate an Application Key and/or create an
    OAuth registration within your Exact Online.

    In Exact Online you can create an app registration for private use
    (customer account) or an app registration for commercial use (partner
    account). Go to Target groups and site maps for more information.

    If the Register API Key link is not visible in the App Center
    menu you do not have the correct rights to view it. To make the
    link visible go to, Username > My Exact Online > Rights and
    select Manage subscription.

Log into the `Exact Online App Center`_, click MANAGE APPS (APPS BEHEREN);
it should be a large links visible on the Top Right. Make sure the redirect
URI has the same transport+domainname as the site that you wish to connect.

For sites with an internal URI only, you may need to alter the hostname
temporarily when registering. Generate the register URL with
``api.create_auth_request_url`` and alter it as appropriate.

After creating the App, you can go back and fetch the the *Client ID*
and the *Client secret*.

TODO
----

* Right now, the section-links in the README.rst do not work in PyPI:
  the quick jump links fail to emerge.
* Replace base_url with response_url?
* Add travis build stuff.
* Fix automatic versioning so we can stop hardcoding the version in
  setup.py.
* Fix so file Copyright headers are auto-populated (and date-updated).
